- 👋 Hi, I’m @ibrahimputun
- 👀  I am actively improving my skills in the front-end field.
- 🌱 I am open to learning and I follow new technologies. Currently, I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Mui, Sass, TypeScript, and React.
- 💞️ Software development is like an endless ocean; the more I learn, the more I realize how much there is to explore. Researching, learning, and applying these subjects is my passion."
